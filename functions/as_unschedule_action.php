 * Cancel the next occurrence of a scheduled action.

 * While only the next instance of a recurring or cron action is unscheduled by this method, that will also prevent
 * all future instances of that recurring or cron action from being run. Recurring and cron actions are scheduled in
 * a sequence instead of all being scheduled at once. Each successive occurrence of a recurring action is scheduled
 * only after the former action is run. If the next instance is never run, because it's unscheduled by this function,
 * then the following instance will never be scheduled (or exist), which is effectively the same as being unscheduled
 * by this method also.
 *
 * @param string $hook The hook that the job will trigger
 * @param array $args Args that would have been passed to the job
 * @param string $group
 *
 * @return string The scheduled action ID if a scheduled action was found, or empty string if no matching action found.
