/**
 * PSR11 compliant dependency injection container for WooCommerce.
 *
 * Classes in the `src` directory should specify dependencies from that directory via an 'init' method having arguments
 * with type hints. If an instance of the container itself is needed, the type hint to use is \Psr\Container\ContainerInterface.
 *
 * Classes in the `src` directory should interact with anything outside (especially code in the `includes` directory
 * and WordPress functions) by using the classes in the `Proxies` directory. The exception is idempotent
 * functions (e.g. `wp_parse_url`), those can be used directly.
 *
 * Classes in the `includes` directory should use the `wc_get_container` function to get the instance of the container when
 * they need to get an instance of a class from the `src` directory.
 *
 * Class registration should be done via service providers that inherit from Automattic\WooCommerce\Internal\DependencyManagement
 * and those should go in the `src\Internal\DependencyManagement\ServiceProviders` folder unless there's a good reason
 * to put them elsewhere. All the service provider class names must be in the `SERVICE_PROVIDERS` constant.
 *
 * IMPORTANT NOTE: By default an instance of RuntimeContainer will be used as the underlying container,
 * but it's possible to use the old ExtendedContainer (backed by the PHP League's container package) instead,
 * see RuntimeContainer::should_use() for configuration instructions.
 * The League's container, the ExtendedContainer class and the related support code will be removed in WooCommerce 10.0.
